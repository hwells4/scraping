# 👋 Start Here

Welcome to your web scraping project!

## First Time Setup (2 minutes)

Just say to Claude:

```
"Help me set this up"
```

Or:

```
"Run the setup"
```

Claude will automatically:
- ✅ Check your Node.js version
- ✅ Install all dependencies
- ✅ Set up Playwright browsers
- ✅ Configure Firecrawl (optional)
- ✅ Set up MCP servers (optional)
- ✅ Test everything works

**That's it!** Claude handles everything for you.

## Already Set Up?

If you've already run setup, just say:

```
"I want to scrape [URL]"
```

Claude will:
1. Explore your target site (5-6 pages)
2. Analyze the structure
3. Generate a custom scraping script
4. Tell you how to run it

---

## What This Project Does

**In simple terms:**
- You tell Claude what website to scrape
- Claude figures out the best way to do it
- Claude creates a script for you
- You run the script and get your data

**No technical knowledge needed.**

## Examples

### Example 1: Blog Posts
```
You: "Scrape all posts from techblog.com"
Claude: [analyzes site]
       "Use this command: npm run techblog-scrape"
You: [runs command]
Result: All blog posts saved to file
```

### Example 2: Product Listings
```
You: "Get products from shop.com/products"
Claude: [analyzes site]
       "Generated Playwright script"
You: [runs command]
Result: Products with prices saved
```

### Example 3: Directory
```
You: "Scrape the company directory"
Claude: [analyzes pagination]
       "Found 200 pages, here's the script"
You: [runs command]
Result: Complete directory data
```

## Two Commands You Need

### 1. Setup (first time only)
```
"Help me set this up"
```

### 2. Scrape (anytime)
```
"I want to scrape [URL]"
```

That's literally it.

## Files to Read (Optional)

- **USAGE.md** - Detailed usage guide with examples
- **QUICKSTART.md** - Reference for common tasks
- **README.md** - Full technical documentation
- **MCP_CONFIG.md** - Advanced MCP setup

But honestly? You don't need to read anything.

Just say "set this up" then "scrape this site" and you're done.

---

## Need Help?

At any point, just ask Claude:
- "How do I scrape [specific thing]?"
- "What's the status of my setup?"
- "Can you help me with [problem]?"

Claude will guide you through everything.
